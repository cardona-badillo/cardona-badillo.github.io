            Bankruptcy-Induced Random Assignment in Colombia</b>  (2023). With <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/leonardobonilla" target="_blank" class="externalsites">Leonardo Bonilla</a>, <a href="https://nicholaswpapageorge.com/" target="_blank" class="externalsites">Nick Papageorge</a>, Christian Posso, and Matthew Zahn. <a href="https://nicholaswpapageorge.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/health.pdf" target="_blank" class="externalsites">[Working Paper].</a>.
        <p class="content">We examine the effect of random assignment to health insurance plans on
            mortality and healthcare utilization. Our data are from Colombia, which provides a unique
            context to study how health plans affect outcomes. First, the entire public healthcare system
            is a form of “managed competition” where profit-seeking firms receive government subsidies
            to provide healthcare to patients, with the exact same financial coverage. Second, when
            
            health insurance firms go bankrupt, which happens with some frequency, patients are ran-
            domly assigned to remaining firms by a government scheme that mimics a “shift-share”
            
            instrumental variable. We exploit this random assignment to assess how different insur-
            ances companies affect patients. We first provide evidence that random assignment works
            
            as intended: actual assignment is nearly identical to what the government’s randomization
            scheme would suggest. Two, we show that bankruptcies in general lead to lower average
            mortality, suggesting that firms going bankrupt do a relatively poor job of keeping patients
            alive and that “managed competition” helps remove particularly bad firms from the market.
            Third, we show healthcare utilization declines following a bankruptcy, which we attribute to
            the reallocation of patients to more efficient health insurers.</p>

Central Bank of Colombia. <a href="https://repositorio.banrep.gov.co/handle/20.500.12134/10699" target="_blank" class="externalsites">[Policy Report]</a>.
        <p class="content">The article provides an overview of institutional aspects, mechanisms, and funding sources in the Colombia's healthcare system. Through the use of general equilibrium models, the study assesses the impacts of various risks faced by the healthcare system, considering their effects on sector finances, fiscal deficit, and macroeconomic variables. These risks encompass the implications of demographic changes, characterized by population aging, shifts in morbidity patterns—especially linked to the rise of non-communicable diseases—and the adoption of new medical technologies. Additionally, the study explores the effects of informality and economic growth on the fiscal resource needs within the sector. It concludes that the country could undergo a significant increase in necessary public spending to finance the healthcare system in Colombia, amounting to 1.9% of GDP by 2030. The article also presents estimates of efficiency measures and economies of scale for healthcare promotion companies and Institutions Providing Health Services, underscoring the significance of resource efficiency within the system to alleviate pressures on public spending.</p>
